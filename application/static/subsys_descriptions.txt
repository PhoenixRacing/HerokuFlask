Electrical

Integrates a speedometer and tachometer with wireless datalogging and driver communications.

Electrical is the newest Phoenix Racing subsystem. We're responsible for everything from wiring the car's brake lights, to monitoring car speed, to maintaining the team website.

This year, we will be focusing on creating simulations to validate the subsystem designs for drivetrain, body, and suspension. We will also be equipping the car with a sensor suite to allow us to conduct real-time failure analysis on the car and to provide the driver with useful data during races and practice drives. 


Suspension

Suspension seeks to optimize the car’s handling and insure that it can tackle as many of the competition obstacles as possible. Before designing any parts, we create complex geometric sketches that predict the roll axis, camber, toe, Ackerman, and steering radius of the car. From these sketches we design the suspension to be durable and replaceable to weather the difficult obstacles that the car faces. 

This year, we want to further decrease the turning radius, correct handling issues that surfaced at competition, do more comprehensive analysis on the loads that the suspension is subjected to, and to perfect our adjustable shock mount design: an Olin original idea that allows us to even out the handling characteristics for drivers of all weights.


Drivetrain

Designs and fabricates our gearbox around an adapted differential and tunes our CVT.

Drivetrain Subteam is responsible for everything from the engine output shaft to the gearbox input, and our job is to manage the transfer of power from the engine to the wheels. Beginning with desired overarching performance characteristics, we design, select, adapt, and tune drivetrain components that enable the car to perform at desired specifications. This may involve vendor parts or parts we design and fabricate ourselves.

Last year, we used a team-designed 2-stage chain reduction, housed in billet aluminum machined in-house at Olin College, along with a tunable CVT. This year, we plan on redesigning our drivetrain from the ground up, including a single-level, size-reduced drivetrain, as well as a new CVT and differential. Our design changes will be focused primarily on optimizing our car’s center of gravity and making our drivetrain more robust in order to endure longer races with fewer, more easily serviceable failures.


Chassis

Designs our frame from 4130 chromoly steel tube and performs structural analysis.

Body Subteam is in charge of the chassis, stylistic elements, and driver interface. Goals for this year include making the chassis smaller and making sure that everyone on the team can drive the car safely and comfortably.

This year will be the third year in a row that the team is building an entirely new car, which opens up many opportunities for redesign and testing. Some examples of redesign for this year include making the car smaller overall to cut down weight and increase maneuverability and handling, to take a look at different types of bracing to make sure the car can handle significant impacts, and to insure that all members of the team can drive the car safely and in accordance with the SAE technical rules. We learned a lot while designing the chassis last year and will include elements such as ease of manufacturing that were vital to building the last car.

Using FEA (Finite Element Analysis) we are able to simulate impacts on the car to insure driver safety. Building sketch models around drivers help visualize designs and improve driver interface. These and other techniques are combined with SolidWorks CAD to design a car to meet our goals.

Building the chassis is not possible without the help of the Olin Machine Shop where team members are trained to use a variety of techniques and machines to help put the car together. We are able to use tools like the water jet cutter and CNC router to insure that parts are made with precision.
